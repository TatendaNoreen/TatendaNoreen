**Version 1.0.0**
Agent based model for selecting and plotting random points on a raster surface.

The model(Agent Based Model- model.py) runs in Spyder on python to randomly select agents in a geographical space while eating the remaing agents until the stop condition is satisfied and then the model stops running.

The result is an animated graphic showing the selection, moving and eating of points on a raster surface in a seperate model window.

This is activated by running the code for model.py in spyder and then running the model in the resulting window using the following steps:
run -> agent based model -> model -> run

The model will run on a colored raster file with multicolored agents being randomly selected in an animated window and all the agents which are being aeten resulting in the blackening of the areas which the agents have been selected already.
